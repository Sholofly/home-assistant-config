## gpsoauth stub expectations

* `gpsoauth.perform_oauth` requires the third positional argument (`android_id`) to be an **integer**. Helpers must resolve or convert IDs into the numeric representation (for example, `int(hex_value, 16)` for cached values stored as hexadecimal strings) before invoking the API. Regression tests (for example, `tests/test_adm_token_retrieval.py::test_async_request_token_uses_cached_android_id`) assert this behavior. When editing `gpsoauth.pyi`, update the stub signature to `perform_oauth(email: str, aas_token: str, android_id: int, *, service: str, app: str, client_sig: str) -> dict[str, Any]` so type checkers reflect the runtime and test contract.
* `gpsoauth.perform_master_login` mirrors the same positional types (`email: str`, `password: str`, `android_id: int`). Provide the integer form of the identifier directly—do **not** stringify the value. Stored `"0x"`-prefixed IDs must be normalized into their integer value ahead of time so downstream helpers stay consistent, and mirror the signature change in the stub when updating it.
* Both functions return a `dict[str, Any]` containing response keys like `"Token"`, `"Auth"`, and `"Error"`. Persist this annotation so mypy strict remains satisfied when parsing the response payload.

When the upstream stubs change, update this file and adjust the affected call sites so that future type-checking runs remain stable.

## Linting reminder

Keep `TYPE_CHECKING` aliases only when the alias is referenced in the module. Remove stale aliases during cleanups so linting runs stay predictable and reviewers can confirm no runtime imports are hidden behind unused guards.

## Shared helper preference

When multiple modules need the same small utility (for example, `_mask_email_for_logs`), define it once in a shared helper module and import it at module scope rather than re-importing inside functions. Centralizing helpers avoids circular-import traps and prevents Ruff from flagging inline imports.

### FCM activity health helper

The FCM supervisor uses a shared activity-health helper (freshness window + snapshot structure) to decide when a client is healthy, stale, or needs a restart. Reuse the existing helper and timestamp fields (`last_activity_monotonic`, freshness window constants, snapshot shape) rather than introducing new window values or parallel health calculations so diagnostics and coordinator state remain consistent across entries.

## Cache key conventions

Android IDs and related identifiers stored in `TokenCache` must follow predictable, per-user keys so helpers avoid collisions between accounts:

* **AAS/FCM Android IDs:** `android_id_<username>` — always the normalized username string (entry-scoped) as the suffix.
* **FCM credential bundle:** `fcm_credentials` — contains the `gcm.android_id` value that downstream helpers normalize and cache under the key above.

When adding new cache-backed helpers under this directory, reuse these patterns (prefix + username suffix) so multi-account setups remain isolated and future helpers can retrieve existing values without guessing.

## Cookie handling

When reading cookies from external authentication flows (for example, Selenium-managed sessions), always validate both the presence and the expected type of each field before use. In particular, confirm that the `"value"` entry resolves to a `str` and raise a descriptive exception if validation fails so helpers consuming the data can rely on strict return contracts.

## Logging guardrails

* Prefer `exc_info=<err>` over interpolating exception text into log messages so token- or credential-related details remain out of the log stream while still preserving traceback context for debugging.
* When referencing account identifiers in logs, always mask them via `_mask_email_for_logs` (available from `aas_token_retrieval`) instead of embedding raw usernames or email addresses.

### Preferred logger pattern

Use structured extras plus `exc_info` to keep tokens and raw error text out of messages:

```python
_LOGGER.debug(
    "Token probe failed; mapped error key.",
    extra={
        "token_source": source,
        "error_key": key,
        "email": _mask_email_for_logs(email),
    },
    exc_info=err,
)
```

**Quick template for reviewers/authors:**

```python
_LOGGER.info(
    "<short summary without secrets>",
    extra={
        "user": _mask_email_for_logs(username),
        "context_key": context_value,
    },
    exc_info=err,  # include only when a traceback is helpful
)
```

Keep sensitive strings (tokens, response bodies, raw exception text) out of the
message itself and prefer short context keys in `extra` so log processing stays
consistent and Semgrep does not flag credential leaks.
