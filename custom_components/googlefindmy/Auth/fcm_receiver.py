"""Backward-compatibility shim for legacy FCM receiver.

This module used to expose a standalone FCM stack via `FcmReceiver`. The integration
now runs a single, shared HA-managed receiver (`FcmReceiverHA`) that is acquired and
released in `__init__.py`. To avoid spawning a second stack (and to keep imports from
older code paths from breaking), this shim provides a minimal, non-invasive surface.

Notes
-----
- This shim does **not** start or own any FCM client.
- It reads already-persisted credentials (token cache) for `get_fcm_token()` /
  `get_android_id()`.
- `register_for_location_updates()` is accepted for compatibility but is a no-op; the
  new design routes device-scoped callbacks through the shared receiver only.
- `stop_listening()` is a no-op (the shared receiver lifecycle is owned by HA).

If you still call into this file directly, please migrate to the shared receiver:
`from custom_components.googlefindmy.Auth.fcm_receiver_ha import FcmReceiverHA`
