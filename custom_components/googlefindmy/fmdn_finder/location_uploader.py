"""FMDN Location Report Encryptor & Uploader.

Encrypts location data using the FMDN cryptographic primitives and creates
protobuf messages for upload to Google's FMDN backend.

Encryption Flow:
1. Resolve scanner location (Bermuda area → HA Zone → GPS)
2. Check upload throttling (FMDN spec: distance/time gating)
3. Serialize location to protobuf
4. Encrypt with EID public key (ECDH + AES-EAX)
5. Upload to Google FMDN backend
