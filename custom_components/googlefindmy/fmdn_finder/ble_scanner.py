"""Optional HA-Bluetooth FMDN advertisement listener.

Registers a callback on Home Assistant's built-in Bluetooth scanner to capture
FMDN advertisements directly, without requiring Bermuda.  This provides:

- **BLE MAC address collection** for future GATT ring connections (Phase 2)
- **RSSI capture** for proximity estimation
- **Frame-type detection** (0x40 normal / 0x41 UTP separated state)

The callback piggybacks on HA's existing scanner — no additional BLE scanning
overhead is introduced.  If the ``bluetooth`` integration is not loaded, setup
is silently skipped (``after_dependencies`` ensures correct load order).

All data is fed into the existing EID Resolver via ``resolve_eid()`` with the
``ble_address`` kwarg, populating ``BLEScanInfo`` for each resolved device.

This module is independent of the FMDN Finder (location upload) feature and
can be enabled even when ``FEATURE_FMDN_FINDER_ENABLED`` is False.
