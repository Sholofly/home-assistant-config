# custom_components/googlefindmy/AGENTS.md

This directory now exposes focused AGENT files grouped by topic so contributors can jump directly to the guidance they need.
Each linked file below applies to **every** module under `custom_components/googlefindmy/` unless a more specific AGENT in a
child directory overrides it.

## Topical index

| Topic | File |
| --- | --- |
| Config flows, reconfigure hooks, and service validation | [`agents/config_flow/AGENTS.md`](agents/config_flow/AGENTS.md) |
| Runtime lifecycle patterns, platform forwarding, and subentry helpers (**entity lifecycle requirements live here**) | [`agents/runtime_patterns/AGENTS.md`](agents/runtime_patterns/AGENTS.md) |
| Typing reminders, stub imports, and strict mypy expectations | [`agents/typing_guidance/AGENTS.md`](agents/typing_guidance/AGENTS.md) |

### FHNA frame slicing reminder

BLE FHNA service data places the frame type at octet 7 (0x40 legacy / 0x41 modern) with the EID starting at octet 8. Resolver updates must keep these offsets authoritative and only fall back to the 1-byte header layout when the service-data pattern does not apply.

### SPOT/gRPC client reminder

When reusing the shared grpclib transport (`SpotGrpcTransport`), keep SSL context creation lazy and ensure ALPN includes `h2`. The transport helper already sets the protocol list and should be closed on unload so new channels negotiate HTTP/2 cleanly.

## Cross-reference index

* [`tests/AGENTS.md`](../../tests/AGENTS.md) — Discovery and reconfigure test stubs, including the lightweight `ConfigEntry` doubles referenced across the topical guides above.
  * Tests often monkeypatch `hass.async_create_task` with lightweight stand-ins. When authoring platform code, either guard direct calls (for example, verify the attribute exists before invoking it) or update the runtime-patterns guide with the expected stub signature so regressions like the coordinator listener crash do not resurface.
  * Keep the coordinator stub in `tests/conftest.py` aligned with new runtime helpers (for example, visibility-wait utilities) to avoid missing-attribute regressions during setup.
  * The `_async_create_task` helper in `custom_components/googlefindmy/__init__.py` intentionally delegates directly to `hass.async_create_task` with the optional `name` argument. Avoid reintroducing alternate scheduling paths that enqueue coroutines multiple times; update tests instead if new task semantics are required.
* [`docs/CONFIG_SUBENTRIES_HANDBOOK.md`](../../docs/CONFIG_SUBENTRIES_HANDBOOK.md) — Canonical reference for config subentry setup/unload flows.
  * When changing config entry or subentry behavior (flows, platform forwarding, `runtime_data` layout), cross-check the handbook and cite the relevant sections in PR descriptions or code comments that rely on guarantees such as data-only `ConfigSubentry` objects or the absence of `config_subentry_id` in `async_forward_entry_setups`.

When adding new guidance, prefer creating another `agents/<topic>/AGENTS.md` file instead of expanding this index. This keeps
updates like the subentry unload reminder easy to place without scrolling through unrelated instructions.

### Quick-start reminder: avoid false-positive tracker discovery

When restoring `device_tracker` entities on startup, confirm the cloud discovery trigger only fires for **truly new** tracker
entities. Reuse the coordinator's registry helpers (for example, `find_tracker_entity_entry`) **after** entities are scheduled
to detect whether each scheduled entity already exists in the entity registry and skip the discovery flow when all restored
devices are known. Centralizing this post-scheduling gate prevents redundant pre-checks and keeps the "X devices found"
notification from reappearing after restarts when no new hardware has been added. Cross-link:
[`agents/runtime_patterns/AGENTS.md`](agents/runtime_patterns/AGENTS.md#tracker-registry-gating)
tracks the canonical post-scheduling gate that platform guides should mirror.

### Async test execution contract

Within `tests/`, **never** call `asyncio.run()` to drive coroutines. Home Assistant’s
test harness already provides a managed event loop via `pytest-asyncio`; starting a
new loop inside a test causes fixture clashes and resource leaks. Mark coroutine tests
with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` (or set `pytestmark = pytest.mark.asyncio` in the module)
and `await` the coroutine directly.

### Nova API cache provider registration

When decrypting FCM background location payloads, **always** register the active entry cache with
`nova_request.register_cache_provider` immediately before calling the Nova async decryptor and **always**
unregister it in a `finally` block. The decryptor resolves credentials via this provider, so skipping registration or
running decryption in an executor without the surrounding context will cause multi-account setups to fail silently.
Handle `StaleOwnerKeyError` from the decryptor by logging and skipping the update instead of crashing the pipeline so key
rotation can proceed without interrupting other accounts.

Normalize FCM canonic IDs before validation (for example, compare `response_canonic_id.lower()` to
`canonic_device_id.lower()` and store the lowercase string on decrypted payloads) so tracker updates are not discarded due
to server-provided hex casing differences.

### Hybrid Low-Accuracy Polling

When a poll response fails the accuracy threshold, `coordinator.py` preserves the previous coordinates and accuracy but still
updates the new `last_seen` timestamp. This keeps map pins stable (no "jumping" to poor fixes) while reflecting that the device
recently reported. The cold-start drop path (no cached coordinates available) strips `_report_hint` before returning; mirror that
hint-stripping step in any new helpers that short-circuit low-quality updates so internal metadata never leaks into entity
state.

### Authentication failure propagation

When a location decrypt/FCM callback encounters `SpotApiEmptyResponseError`, store the exception on the callback context and
re-raise it after the waiter resumes so the coordinator can translate it into `ConfigEntryAuthFailed`. This keeps invalid
sessions flowing into Home Assistant's reauthentication UI instead of being swallowed in background threads.

### Import deferral reminder

Heavyweight runtime dependencies (for example, browser drivers such as `undetected_chromedriver`) must be imported lazily inside
the helpers that use them. Avoid module-level imports that execute expensive discovery logic during Home Assistant startup—wrap
the import in a small getter and call it only from the executor-backed runtime path.

When adding a lazy import helper, **keep the corresponding `import_module` (or other loader) imported in the module** so static
analysis tools like `ruff` retain full visibility into the call site. Dropping the import and relying solely on dynamic
resolution causes undefined-name lint failures the next time the file is checked.

### Network Status Codes & Privacy Mapping

Use the proto/network label mapping below when interpreting report provenance or introducing new UI strings so contributor
privacy semantics remain aligned with Google's contribution settings.

| Proto Enum | Integration Label | Real-world Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Status.CROWDSOURCED = 2` | `'crowdsourced'` | Location report from a finder contributing with network in **all areas** ("Contribution Settings: With network in all areas"). |
| `Status.AGGREGATED = 3` | `'aggregated'` | Location report from a finder contributing with network in **high-traffic areas only** ("Contribution Settings: With network in high-traffic areas only"). |
| `EncryptedReport.isOwnReport = true` or `Status.LAST_KNOWN = 1` | `'owner'` | Owner-sourced location report from the device itself. |
