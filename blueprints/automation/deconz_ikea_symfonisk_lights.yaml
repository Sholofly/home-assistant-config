blueprint:
  name: Deconz - IKEA SYMFONISK for lights
  description: 'Control lights with an IKEA SYMFONISK from the Deconz integration.

    Pushing the button once, toggles the lights on/off to the last set
    brightness (unless the force brightness is toggled on in the blueprint).
    Rotating left/right will change the brightness.

    The button can be pressed double or triple, these actions can be assigned
    freely. This allows you to assign, e.g., a scene or anything else.

    Thanks to @Frenck. I modified his ZHA version to make it useful for Deconz.
